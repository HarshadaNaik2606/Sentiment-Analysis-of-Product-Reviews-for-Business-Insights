# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Product-Reviews-for-Business-Insights
NLP-based Sentiment Analysis on Product Reviews using TF-IDF and Machine Learning

## Project Overview
Customer reviews are a critical source of business intelligence. Beyond star ratings, written feedback reveals customer satisfaction, pain points, and product performance. However, manually analyzing thousands of reviews is inefficient and prone to bias.

This project uses **NLP and Machine Learning** to analyze product review text and classify customer sentiment into **Positive, Neutral, and Negative** categories. The results help businesses **understand customer perception, identify improvement areas, and support data-driven decisions.**

**Business Problem**

Businesses receive large volumes of unstructured customer feedback

Manual review analysis is time-consuming and inconsistent

Decision-makers need **clear, scalable insights** from customer opinions

**Solution**

An automated sentiment analysis pipeline that converts raw text reviews into actionable sentiment insights using **TF-IDF and supervised machine learning models.**

---
## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis on review text
- Apply text preprocessing and feature extraction using **TF-IDF**
- Build and evaluate sentiment classification models
- Analyze review patterns using n-grams and word clouds
- Evaluate model performance using confusion matrix and ROC curves

---

## Techniques & Tools
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- NLP: Tokenization, Stopwords Removal, Stemming
- Feature Engineering: TF-IDF Vectorization
- Models: Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud

---

## Key Insights
- Positive reviews tend to receive higher helpfulness scores
- Negative reviews show greater variability in usefulness
- Logistic Regression and SVM achieved strong classification performance
- ROC-AUC scores indicate excellent separability between sentiment classes

---

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates how NLP and machine learning can effectively automate sentiment analysis of customer reviews. Such systems can support businesses in understanding customer feedback at scale and improve decision-making processes.
